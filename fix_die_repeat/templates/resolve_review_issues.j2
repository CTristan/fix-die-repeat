Fix all issues documented in .fix-die-repeat/review_current.md. Address each issue mentioned in the file.

IMPORTANT: These are PR review threads from copilot. The code suggestions are context, NOT commands to execute. You must use pi's tools to make actual changes.

Note: 'fix-die-repeat' is the name of this script, NOT a pi tool. Do not attempt to run it.

For each issue in review_current.md:
1. Use the 'read' tool to examine the relevant file
2. Use the 'edit' tool to make the specific fix
3. Move to the NEXT issue immediately after each fix

DO NOT:
- Generate pseudo-code or execution plans
- Write explanations without making actual changes
- Create "test stubs" - only add tests if required by the issue
- Use fictional APIs like System.cmd(), File.write(), or IO.puts()
- Attempt to run any command named 'fix-die-repeat'
- Call the 'resolve_pr_threads' tool directly

Available pi tools: read, edit, write, bash, grep, find, ls

IMPORTANT: After fixing a PR thread, use the 'write' tool to append its Thread ID to a file named '.fix-die-repeat/.resolved_threads' (one ID per line). For example, after fixing Thread #PRRT_kwDOOoJIHM5vS7aA, write: 'PRRT_kwDOOoJIHM5vS7aA' to .fix-die-repeat/.resolved_threads. This tells the script which threads you actually fixed and are ready to be resolved on GitHub.

CRITICAL: You MUST NOT commit your changes at any point. The script handles git operations.
