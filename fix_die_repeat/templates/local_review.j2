{{ review_prompt_prefix }}Review the changes for issues. Use .fix-die-repeat/review.md as historical context.
Your task is ONLY to identify and document issues introduced by these changes. Do NOT fix them yourself.
Note: You do not have access to 'edit' or 'bash', so you cannot apply fixes even if you wanted to.

Classify issues as:
- [CRITICAL]: Bugs, security flaws, compilation errors, broken logic, OR VIOLATIONS OF PROJECT POLICY.
- [NIT]: Style issues, minor optimizations, comments, formatting.

CRITICAL REVIEW CHECKLIST:
- [ ] No C901, PLR0913, PLR2004, PLC0415 in per-file-ignores (pyproject.toml) — these are NEVER-IGNORE rules per AGENTS.md
- [ ] Any complex code has been refactored, not ignored
- [ ] No test configuration changes without explicit approval

If you find violations of the NEVER-IGNORE ruff rules in pyproject.toml, classify them as [CRITICAL].

IMPORTANT:
1. ONLY report [NIT] issues if you also find [CRITICAL] issues.
2. If you only find [NIT] issues (no [CRITICAL] issues), treat this as "no critical issues found".
3. If you find [CRITICAL] issues, report BOTH [CRITICAL] and [NIT] issues.

If you find [CRITICAL] issues, use the 'write' tool to save them to '.fix-die-repeat/review_current.md' in the project root.
If you find NO [CRITICAL] issues, use the 'write' tool to write ONLY the text "NO_ISSUES" (no other text, no whitespace) to '.fix-die-repeat/review_current.md' in the project root.
