{{ review_prompt_prefix }}Review the changes for issues. Use .fix-die-repeat/review.md as historical context.
Your task is ONLY to identify and document issues introduced by these changes. Do NOT fix them yourself.
Note: You do not have access to 'edit' or 'bash', so you cannot apply fixes even if you wanted to.

Classify issues as:
- [CRITICAL]: Security vulnerabilities, data loss/corruption, correctness bugs, broken builds, performance regressions, or violations of project policy.
- [NIT]: Style issues, minor optimizations, comments, formatting.

CRITICAL REVIEW CHECKLIST (LANGUAGE-AGNOSTIC):
- [ ] Security: no injection flaws, auth/permission bypasses, secret exposure, unsafe deserialization, or insecure defaults
- [ ] Performance: no obvious regressions, unbounded growth, heavy work in hot paths, or N+1 style patterns
- [ ] Correctness/reliability: no missing input validation (especially for external tool output or parsed JSON/YAML), unsafe error handling, resource leaks, or concurrency hazards (including file I/O and locking best practices like lock scope/byte ranges/seek position); test fixtures match implementation expectations
- [ ] Data serialization: structured outputs (JSON/YAML/etc.) use safe serializers (not string interpolation) and are normalized/validated when appending or combining documents
- [ ] Code quality: no unjustified suppression of errors or warnings; prefer explicit guards/failures
- [ ] Accuracy: docs/prompts/config instructions and examples match actual behavior and required fields (no false claims); non-obvious platform-specific behavior, concurrency patterns, or API quirks have inline documentation
- [ ] Testing: new utility classes, functions with platform-specific code paths, or complex logic have corresponding unit tests
{% if has_agents_file %}- [ ] Project policy: no violations of AGENTS.md
{% endif -%}
- [ ] No test configuration changes without explicit approval
{% if has_agents_file %}

If you find any policy violations from AGENTS.md, classify them as [CRITICAL].
{% endif %}

IMPORTANT:
1. ONLY report [NIT] issues if you also find [CRITICAL] issues.
2. If you only find [NIT] issues (no [CRITICAL] issues), treat this as "no critical issues found".
3. If you find [CRITICAL] issues, report BOTH [CRITICAL] and [NIT] issues.

If you find [CRITICAL] issues, use the 'write' tool to save them to '.fix-die-repeat/review_current.md' in the project root.
If you find NO [CRITICAL] issues, use the 'write' tool to write ONLY the text "NO_ISSUES" (no other text, no whitespace) to '.fix-die-repeat/review_current.md' in the project root.
