{{ review_prompt_prefix }}Review the changes for issues. Use .fix-die-repeat/review.md as historical context.
Your task is ONLY to identify and document issues introduced by these changes. Do NOT fix them yourself.
Note: You do not have access to 'edit' or 'bash', so you cannot apply fixes even if you wanted to.

Classify issues as:
- [CRITICAL]: Bugs, security flaws, compilation errors, broken logic.
- [NIT]: Style issues, minor optimizations, comments, formatting.

IMPORTANT:
1. ONLY report [NIT] issues if you also find [CRITICAL] issues.
2. If you only find [NIT] issues (no [CRITICAL] issues), treat this as "no critical issues found".
3. If you find [CRITICAL] issues, report BOTH [CRITICAL] and [NIT] issues.

If you find [CRITICAL] issues, use the 'write' tool to save them to '.fix-die-repeat/review_current.md' in the project root.
If you find NO [CRITICAL] issues, use the 'write' tool to create an EMPTY file named '.fix-die-repeat/review_current.md' in the project root.
DO NOT write any text to the file if there are no critical issues — it must be empty.
