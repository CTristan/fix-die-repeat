REQUIRED: After completing your response, you MUST end your response with a confidence footer on its own line:
CONFIDENCE=<number>
Where <number> is a value between 0 and 1 (e.g., CONFIDENCE=0.95, CONFIDENCE=0.72). This indicates how confident you are that your work is correct and complete.

IMPORTANT: If your confidence is below {{ threshold }}, you MUST ALSO use the 'write' tool to document your concerns to .fix-die-repeat/low_confidence_concerns.md. Describe:
- What specifically you are uncertain about
- Why you cannot proceed with higher confidence
- What additional information would help you proceed
