I've found {{ unresolved_count }} unresolved review threads on PR #{{ pr_number }} ({{ pr_url }}).

Please review each thread, check the associated code, and determine if a fix is required.
If a fix is needed, apply it. If not, explain why.

CRITICAL: For each thread below, the 'ID' is the GraphQL thread ID. This is the ID you must use when marking threads as resolved.
When you decide a thread is resolved, add its ID to the .fix-die-repeat/.resolved_threads file (one ID per line); the runner will use that file to resolve those threads.
If a thread does not need a code change, clearly explain why in your answer for that thread so your reasoning is captured, but do not call any tools like 'resolve_pr_threads' or 'reply_to_thread' directly.
