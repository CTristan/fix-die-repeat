I have attached a file containing PR review thread data from a completed fix-die-repeat run.
This includes the original reviewer comments, whether the agent fixed or declined each issue,
and the diff of changes made.

Your task is to produce a YAML document that categorizes each PR thread for future prompt improvement.
This data will be used later to identify gaps in the review and fix prompt templates.

For each thread, also assess whether the issue is language-specific. If so, check whether
the current language-specific checklist (lang_checks/*.j2) would catch it. If not, suggest
a concrete checklist item that could be added to the appropriate language partial.

For each thread, provide:
- id: The exact GraphQL thread ID (copy from the input data)
- title: A concise, descriptive title (max 10 words)
- category: One of: security, error-handling, performance, correctness, code-quality, testing, documentation, configuration (or a new category if none fit)
- outcome: "fixed" or "wont-fix"
- summary: 1-2 sentences describing what the reviewer flagged and what the agent did
- reason: (only for wont-fix) Why the agent declined to fix
- relevance: 1-2 sentences assessing whether this type of issue could be caught earlier by improved review/fix prompt templates
- lang_check_gap: If this issue is language-specific, would an existing lang_checks partial have caught it? If not, suggest a specific checklist item to add. Write "n/a" if the issue is language-agnostic.

Output ONLY valid YAML matching this structure (no markdown fencing, no extra text):

date: "{{ run_date }}"
project: "{{ project_name }}"
pr_number: {{ pr_number }}
pr_url: "{{ pr_url }}"
status: pending
threads:
  - id: "<thread_id>"
    title: "<concise title>"
    category: "<category>"
    outcome: "<fixed|wont-fix>"
    summary: >
      <summary text>
    reason: >
      <reason for wont-fix (omit for fixed)>
    relevance: >
      <relevance assessment>
    lang_check_gap: >
      <language-specific gap analysis or n/a>

Use the 'write' tool to save the YAML output to '{{ output_path }}'.
