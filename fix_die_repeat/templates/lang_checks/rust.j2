Rust:
- [ ] `unsafe` blocks are justified, minimal in scope, and documented
- [ ] No `.unwrap()` / `.expect()` in library code — propagate errors with `?`
- [ ] No unbounded `.collect()` on untrusted iterators (DoS vector)
- [ ] Mutex guards are not held across `.await` points
- [ ] Clippy `#[allow(...)]` attributes are justified with comments
- [ ] No `as` casts that could silently truncate — use `try_into()`
