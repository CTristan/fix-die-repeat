Your goal is to FIX the errors. Follow this plan:
1. ANALYZE the log and identify the root cause.
2. PLAN your fix.
3. APPLY the fix using 'edit'.
4. VERIFY with a quick targeted check (e.g., compile the affected file, run the specific failing test). You MAY run the checks script (e.g., ./checks.sh or the command in `{{ check_cmd }}`) using the 'bash' tool to verify your fix. Prefer targeted invocations over running the full CI pipeline.
